-> Create png files for icons required in animation. Note that the Julia code expects png files
   (see function animSetIcons), so other image formats likely won't work.

-> Make sure that the items in icons.json match the image filenames (excluding file extension png).

-> It might take some adjusting to get the icons to look the way you like; function updateIcons in 
   index.html can be used to update the icons in the animation without having to reload the simulation 
   and webpage, just call `updateIcons()` from the browser console, but this will require first 
   modifying function updateMarkerIcons in index.html to match the objects (taxis, etc.) that your 
   simulation uses.
