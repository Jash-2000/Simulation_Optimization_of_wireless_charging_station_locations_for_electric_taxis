The network that we are considering has been obtained from OSM and has 241604 nodes(junctions). Obviously, not all the nodes would be connected to each other.

# network-karlsruhe.jld2
	Ditctionary with the 4 keys :- 
    1) TIME - This is 241604X241604 Sparse Matrix and contains time needed to go from row_index to col_index.
	2) DIST - This is 241604X241604 Sparse Matrix and contains distance between node at row_index and col_index.
	3) LATITUDE - The Latitude corresponding to node at that particular index value.
	3) LONGITUDE - The Longitude corresponding to node at that particular index value.
	
# trips-karlsruhe.jld2
	Dictionary containing 46837 trip data and is of the "trip" struct format as defined in types.jl. 
	This file is generated by precompute_trips function in data.jl.
	
# log-karlsruhe.jld2
	Contains the Log struct at end of the simulation.

# calls-karlsruhe.csv
	This files contains the calls made by the passengers at different times of the day. The csv file
	contains the source and the destination nodes for the passengers( This is not necesarily the 
	source and/or destination for the taxis). Also, the time of each call is given which has been
	utilized in the simulation. 

# ranks-karlsruhe.csv
	Contains the details of all the ranks and basically contains the initial state of the simulation.
	The coloumn representing "number of taxis" show how the taxis are placed initially. Also, it is  
	assumed that all the taxis are having full charge at start of the simulation.
